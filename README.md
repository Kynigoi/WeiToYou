# WeiToYou
WeiToYou is an app who uses MultipeerConnectivity and Apple Nearby Interaction frameworks to help you find your friends nearby.
It is similar to how Apple Airtags work, but it allows you to track other IPhones instead of Airtags.
It is also centered around the red thread of fate, infact the symbol of the app is a red ball of wool and it represents the distance
from your beloved friends.
